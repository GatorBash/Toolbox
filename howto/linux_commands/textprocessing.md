## `sort`

`sort` will do just that sort text output</br>

## `uniq`

`uniq` will get rid of lines of redundant information so long as it shows up next to each other</br>
if you have redundant information that does not show up next to each other you can use the `sort` command</br>
to reorder the output so that the `unique` command will be more usefull.</br>
