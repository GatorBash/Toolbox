# Set up for your phone

If you want your phone to not be trying to reach out to differnt cell carriers

make sure you don't have a sim card in it before you turn it on.

this isn't going to disable peoples ability to track you geographicly.

This is due to how phones will always ping nearby towers to use emergency features.

However this will keep people from tracking what apps you have and what and get rid of you needing

to use the app store.

## Dev mode

Turn on your phone if you haven't already.  
- go to settings
- go to "about my phone/device"
- find the section that "build info"
- tap the build tab 6 - 10
- there should be a popup saying you are x number of taps away from becoming a developer
- once complete it will say you are a developer now
