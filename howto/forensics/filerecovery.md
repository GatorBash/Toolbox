# File Recovery

A lot of times when you delete things on a computer or hard drive they are not accually deleted.</br>
All deleting something does is make it inaccessable for the most part and makes the file overwritable</br>
So when people delete thing and they think that those files cannot be recovered they're wrong.</br>
in this file i will provide some reasourses to use to recover data.</br>
this is not for uses illicitly.  Don't steal other peoples stuff.  This is best used in a help desk environment</br>
